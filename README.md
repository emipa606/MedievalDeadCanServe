Update of CapatinSnafus mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1776511809

- Replaced the whole thing with patches that just removes all modern stuff. The mod now requires that https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018891555]Dead Can Serve [Adopted] is loaded before it
